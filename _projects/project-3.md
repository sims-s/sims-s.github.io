# Generating Images of Birds with StyleGAN 🐦
![Real Generated Birbs](/images/BirdGanSamples.png)  
Birds generated by StyleGAN at 128x128 resolution.

## Fixed Noise Gif
![Fixed Noise](/images/BGFixedNoise.gif)  
Sample some random noise and have all model checkpoints produce images with that noise. Plot result over course of training.

## Style Mixing
StyleGAN's input of random noise is fed through a stack of 8 linear layers, creating a latent style vector. That vector goes into the model at each resolution (4x4,8x8,...128x128 - 6 total).  
We can create multiple latent style vectors, from different randiom inputs, and feed different ones into the model at different resolutions.

Here are the results:
* The topmost row & leftmost column are generated with a single style vector each (same one @ all 6 resolutions). These are the "original" birds.
* The other non-original birds are a mix of the two originals in it's row/column.
  * 2/6 latents from its bird in the top row. The latents for this bird come from both the stated resolutions.
  * 4/6 latents from the bird in the left column at the remaining resolutions.
  * Diagonal is mix between itself --> uninteresting

* The very lowest resolutions control the overall orientation of the bird.
* The middle resolutsion seem to control more of the bird. And the high resolutions the background. Though the distinction seems a little more ambigious there.

## Latent Interpolation
Since we're using a latent space, we can interpolate between multiple latent vectors and plot the results at each step.

## FID During Training
[FID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance) measures the quality of a generated dataset compared to a ground truth (50K real images). We can plot it during training and see model improve
